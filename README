About:
------
haploscore.py is a standalone program for computing HaploScore, a haplotype-based
metric that enables accurate IBD detection on population-scale datasets. It is
designed to post-process IBD segments obtained by GERMLINE
(http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~gusev/germline/). The program was developed by
Eric Y. Durand and Cory Y. McLean at 23andMe, Inc. 

Usage:
------
For detailed usage instruction, run
python haploscore.py --help

Note that haplotype.py requires Python 2.7 and numpy 1.7.

Required Input:
---------------
match        GERMLINE-formatted match file. The format is described on http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~gusev/germline/
ped_file     PLINK PED file containing the haplotypes used as input by GERMLINE
map_file     PLINK MAP file containing the physical map for the markers included in the PED file. Must be in genome order

Options:
--------
--genotype_error VALUE  Set the genotyping error rate per marker to VALUE
--switch_error VALUE    Set the switch error rate per marker to VALUE
-v, --verbose           Report progress to stderr
-h, --help              Print help message

Output:
-------
out_file  Output file. It is formatted like the match.gz file but contains an additional last column, the HaploScore value.
